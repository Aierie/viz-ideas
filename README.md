## Resources
### Datasets
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

### Storytelling examples
- Parable of the polgons (interactive visualization): https://ncase.me/polygons/ (Would also recommend any other nicky case creations)
  - I like the interactivity. Letting the user control the visualization makes it much more relatable (MK)
- A visualization of cafes in Moscow: https://cafe.dianov.org/
  - Nice UI, even though I don't understand the language (MK)
