## What is this?
A repository collecting ideas for visualization projects.

## Ideas (with dataset)
- Invasive species in Australia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species_in_Australia
  - MK: Timeline with interactive vis to see the impact. Nicely organized data with clear references, interesting topic to me since I've lived in Australia before. A lot of potential for interesting things since it's multi dimensional. Focus would be the [table of invasive species with the biggest impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species_in_Australia#Animals).
- You want to reduce the carbon footprint of your food?: https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local, dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/02/GHG-emissions-by-life-cycle-stage-OurWorldinData-upload.csv
  - DS: I've already found almost the same theme before, but this one looks not so huge and complex and also I like the thing that data here devided to the parts of supply chain.
- Categorizing cocktails by type of alcohol: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/readme.md
  - DS: It's a cool topic, but since I now want to minimize the amount of alcohol in my life, this is not a best one for me nowadays )))
  - MK: Ah, fair point! 
- Visualization of wars USA was involved in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States
  - MK: Previous work by [Elijah Meeks](http://elijahmeeks.com/wars/) and [Jason Heppler](https://jasonheppler.org/projects/war/)

### Storytelling examples
- Parable of the polgons (interactive visualization): https://ncase.me/polygons/ (Would also recommend any other nicky case creations)
  - MK: I like the interactivity. Letting the user control the visualization makes it much more relatable.
  - D: That's true. Very interesting theme and interactivity. There are quite a numer of social problems and psycologic features which can be revealed the same way.
  It reminded me work in game mode of one foundation where from the very begining you need to choose how often/many you use different things in your usual life, you start to play and enjoy the process, at the end they show to you how much money you spend on it and then gives you information of how many people died mining some particulal resourses of the things which you use in your life.
- A visualization of cafes in Moscow: https://cafe.dianov.org/
  - MK: Nice UI, even though I don't understand the language.
  - D: Yeah, funny. So it's like directory of cafes in Moscow. You can search cafe by it's name or use filters. Color of circles - rating of the place. I like the idea in general, but for me I better choose another theme for this, not about cafes.
- People of the pandemic game: https://peopleofthepandemicgame.com/
  - MK: Merges users' choices with real-world data to tell a story about current issues
  - D: Very interesting, I like this game mode there and that through this game people can change their minds.
- Royal Constellations: http://www.datasketch.es/october/code/nadieh/
  - D: I like how it looks like and also coz of it's interactivity. 
  - MK: Nadieh's work is always great, there aren't many people who work with graphs like she does! I like the aesthetic on this one too.
- All Russian literature of the XIX century in 230 cards: https://arzamas.academy/mag/448-literature
  - D: Each card represents event in Russian history of literature, and also funny thing is that every note has tags, which can forward you to another card. 
  - MK: I like the presentation, it makes what would otherwise be really dry quite explorable. The tags aren't working for me though.
- The Shape of Cities: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/04/maps-show-how-public-transit-and-geography-shape-cities/
  - D: It's interesting to look how geography of cities was changing.
- Death at Home: Visualizing Femicides: https://www.gabriellemerite.com/2019-femicides-in-france/
  - MK: Heavy vis that adds humanity to a topic that can easily become a summary statistic, mixing a nice layout and clear encodings with a mix of personalized touches. She collected the information about each victim by going through social media.
    - D: Nicely done, but little bit hard to read without annotation on the same screen.
- Protests in America: http://protests.space/
  - MK: The making of - https://dataanddragons.wordpress.com/2019/12/12/making-points-of-light-protest-in-america/
  - MK: I like this because of the topic, and the thought and analysis that went into such a complex topic.
