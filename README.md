### Storytelling examples
- Parable of the polgons (interactive visualization): https://ncase.me/polygons/ (Would also recommend any other nicky case creations)
  - I like the interactivity. Letting the user control the visualization makes it much more relatable (MK)
  D: That's true. Very interesting theme and interactivity. There are quite a numer of social problems and psycologic features which can be revealed the same way.
  It reminded me work in game mode of one foundation where from the very begining you need to choose how often/many you use different things in your usual life, you start to play and enjoy the process, at the end they show to you how much money you spend on it and then gives you information of how many people died mining some particulal resourses of the things which you use in your life.
- A visualization of cafes in Moscow: https://cafe.dianov.org/
  - Nice UI, even though I don't understand the language (MK)
  D: Yeah, funny. So it's like directory of cafes in Moscow. You can search cafe by it's name or use filters. Color of circles - rating of the place. I like the idea in general, but for me I better choose another theme for this, not about cafes.
- People of the pandemic game: https://peopleofthepandemicgame.com/
  - Merges users' choices with real-world data to tell a story about current issues (MK)
  D: Very interesting, I like this game mode there and that through this game people can change their minds.
- Royal Constellations: http://www.datasketch.es/october/code/nadieh/
  D: I like how it looks like and also coz of it's interactivity.
- All Russian literature of the XIX century in 230 cards: https://arzamas.academy/mag/448-literature
  D: Each card represents event in Russian history of literature, and also funny thing is that every note has tags, which can forward you to another card.
- The Shape of Cities: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/04/maps-show-how-public-transit-and-geography-shape-cities/
  D: It's interesting to look how geography of cities was changing.
